            Never seen Taskmaster?
          </h2>

          <p class="text-black/60 leading-relaxed">
            If you haven't seen the show, you're in for a treat. <strong>Taskmaster</strong> is a British comedy show where people are given strange, creative,
            and sometimes completely pointless tasks — with very little instruction.
          </p>

          <p class="text-black/60 leading-relaxed">
            Everyone is given the same task, but the fun comes from how differently each person approaches it.
            Clever solutions, unexpected ideas, and mild chaos are all encouraged.
          </p>

          <p class="text-black/60 leading-relaxed">
            There are no “right” answers — just creativity, interpretation, and a lot of laughter.
            That’s exactly the spirit we’re aiming for here.
          </p>

          <div class="pt-2 text-sm text-black/45">
            Creativity beats perfection. Have fun with it.

                            Taskmaster has been one of our favorite shows to watch together — the perfect mix of
                            creativity,
                            chaos, and laughing until it hurts.

                            Over the years, we’ve even recreated it at home with friends, making up ridiculous challenges and arguing (politely) about points.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-black/60 leading-relaxed">
                           Bringing a few Taskmaster-style tasks into the wedding felt like the perfect way to share something we love with the people we love.

                           We will play the role of Taskmaster and will award the winners their grand prize at the reception.
